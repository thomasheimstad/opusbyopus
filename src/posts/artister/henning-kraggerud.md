Norwegian violinist Henning Kraggerud is Artistic Director of the Arctic Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, with a tenure extending to 2020.

Henning’s extraordinary reach as an artist is a result of his versatility and passion for music, as well as the genuine quality to his playing and the beauty of his performances. His teaching and educational writings provide fascinating insights into his multi-faceted approach to music-making, while his composing, arranging and improvising – frequently bringing his own works into the concert hall – recall the spirit of the old masters such as Fritz Kreisler and Eugène Ysaÿe.

Henning is invited time and again to join many of the world’s most significant orchestras, most recently the Toronto Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Baltimore Symphony and Los Angeles Chamber orchestras, as well as the Danish National Symphony, Tonkünstler Orchestra Vienna and Brussels Philharmonic.

Henning regularly performs both on violin and viola at major festivals and venues; recent collaborations have taken place at Wigmore Hall, King’s Place, Bruges Concertgebouw and Berlin Konzerthaus, with artists such as Steven Isserlis, Joshua Bell, Lawrence Power, Leif Ove Andsnes, Håvard Gimse, Imogen Cooper, Adrian Brendel, Christian Poltéra and Jeremy Menuhin. Last season saw Henning appearing at Budapest’s kamara.hu festival, Incontri in Terra di Siena Festival and the West Cork Chamber Music Festival. In the 17/18 season, he returns to the Wigmore Hall with Natalie Clein and Christian Ihle Hadland, performs with the Nash Ensemble in Bern and gives a recital with Kathryn Stott at Musis Arnhem.

In 2015, Henning became International Chair in Violin at the Royal College of Music in Manchester, and in 2017 was announced as the recipient of a Fellowship. Passionate about musical education, Henning is a Professor at the Barratt Due music conservatoire in Oslo, and in 2018 is a Jury member at the Menuhin Competition in Geneva, where he also performs the opening concert with Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

Henning’s eclectic discography includes many recordings on the Naxos label, the most recent being Mozart Concertos Nos. 3, 4 and 5, including Henning’s own cadenzas, with the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. The CD was awarded an ECHO Klassik Award and chosen as Classic FM’s Album of the Week, NDR Kultur’s CD of the Week, Editor’s Choice in Classical Music Magazine, Recommended in The Strad, and featured on BBC Radio 3’s Record Review where it was hailed as “so alive with such engaging articulation”. In 2013, also on Naxos, Henning released Grieg’s three sonatas, arranged for violin and chamber orchestra by Henning and Bernt Simen Lund.

On the Simax label, Henning’s most recent release is a collaboration with the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra and world-famous author Erik Fosnes Hansen. Entitled Between the Seasons, the disc features Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons interspersed with Henning’s own compositions. Also for Simax, Henning has recorded the complete solo sonatas of Ysaÿe, on a disc which won the prestigious Spellemann CD award. On the ACT label, he released a disc entitled Last Spring which explored improvisations on Norwegian folk music with jazz pianist Bugge Wesseltoft. Henning also appeared in a major television and cinema documentary about the Norwegian 19th century violin virtuoso and composer, Ole Bull, and received the Ole Bull Prize in 2007.

Born in Oslo in 1973, Henning studied with Camilla Wicks and Emanuel Hurwitz. He is a recipient of Norway's prestigious Grieg Prize and in 2007 was awarded the Sibelius Prize for his interpretations and recording of Sibelius’ music around the world.

Henning Kraggerud plays on a 1744 Guarneri del Gesù, provided by Dextra Musica AS. This company is founded by Sparebankstiftelsen DNB.
